## Introduction

This is a report on 2010 gun murders obtained by FBI reports. The raw data was obtained from [this wikipedia page]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_the-United-States-by-state).

We are going to use the following library:

```{r loading-libs, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

and load the data we arleady wrangled:

```{r}
load("rda/murders.rda")
```

## Murder rate by state 

We note the large state to state variability by generating a barplot showing the murder rates by state:


```{r murder_rate-by-state, echo=FALSE}
murders %>% mutate(abb=reorder(abb,rate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(abb,rate))+
  geom_bar(width = 0.5,stat = "identity",col="blue")+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw()
```
